### Summary of Contributions

- `Feature`: Note Class
    - What it does: Note is the basic unit of note function, it contains scene index, title, and content. 
    - Justification: This allows user to take a note with scene index, title and content. Scene index is automatically generated by the program, title and content are wrote by 
user.


- `Feature`: NoteList class
    - What it does: The NoteList is a collection of all notes that user created, and it performs all note-related functions, such as\
      create a note, open a note, delete notes, search notes using keywords/scene index.
    - Justification: It performs all note-related functions.


- `Feature`: Search Note using keywords
    - What it does: Allows user to search existing notes with multiple keywords (in note title).
    - Justification: Sometimes if there are too many notes, and user want to find the specific notes with title's keywords, then he/she can simply use this search function and type in as many keywords as they want to search for relevant notes.


- `Feature`: Search Note using scene index
    - What it does: Allows user to search existing notes with scene index. 
    - Justification: As each note contains an automatically generated scene index, when user is investigating, he/she can just type in the scene index and search for notes with that scene index. 


- `Feature`: GameNoteFileManager class
    - What it does: The GameNoteFileManager stores all the existing notes locally, and it will open all stored notes when the game is started. A new note file will be created if there is corruption being detected in the old note file.
    - Justification: After user make changes to notes (like create or delete), all the changes will be saved locally and will be loaded at the start of the game.
