scene #2

Because I live in a remote place, there are not many places to live nearby to go. I carefully compared with the map and vaguely had a guess... Is it where my father went? But... What are you doing there? My father has been in a bit of a trance these two days. It seems that he has something to hide from me. Although he doesn't say it, I also know that his company seems to have been badly hurt by a partner. After all, my father and I are in the same industry, and I have heard a little wind.

If the news is correct, my father should need a lot of money recently. Unfortunately, I have always been extravagant and have no savings. It's difficult to help him...

At noon, Father didn't do the dishes he bought. He seemed worried. And Father simply ate some leftovers from the day before yesterday, and my father turned back to the house to have a rest.

"The past me" was playing games with nothing to do, and suddenly the doorbell rang.

By the way, I remember, it's Wendy. She is my girlfriend. She lives upstairs of my house. She and I have known each other since we were very young. She can be regarded as a childhood sweetheart.

When I was a child, I, Wendy and Kevin had a good relationship since they lived close to each other. 

Wendy has been very good-looking since childhood. The boys who love her have never broken, including me and Kevin.

"Why are you standing there? Give me a pair of slippers!" Wendy shouted at me impatiently as soon as she entered the door. I hurried over and found that Wendy had obviously dressed up carefully, painted beautiful makeup and had a hairstyle. It was very beautiful. She is good everywhere, but she has a quick temper. Because she is an only child, she is not used to her temper. She has been arrogant since childhood.
